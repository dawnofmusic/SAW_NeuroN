			<h2>Welcome to NeuroN.</h2>

			<p>The whole project is based on code (originally written in
				Turbo Pascal) and ideas I created together with Markus Seeger in the
				years 1994-1996. In those days we had the idea to implement a speech
				recognition engine based on neuronal networks.</p>

			<p>The project's aim was to get awarded. We wanted to win a prize
				at the famous German competition called "Jugend forscht". Finally we
				won a special acknowlegdement award from the Hassian State. Not that
				bad...</p>

			<p>I really loved to work on this project, and I thought for
				somebody it could be interesting to get our results. If you're a
				teacher and are interested in more functionality and/or explanation,
				please let me know @dawnofmusic.</p>
